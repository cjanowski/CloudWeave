# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses preparing the full-stack application (Go backend + React frontend) for production deployment on AWS infrastructure. The application currently consists of a Go backend with JWT authentication and a React frontend with glassmorphism UI components. The goal is to implement comprehensive production readiness including containerization, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, security hardening, performance optimization, and scalable AWS infrastructure deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application containerized with Docker, so that it can be deployed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend is containerized THEN the system SHALL create a multi-stage Dockerfile that builds the Go binary and runs it in a minimal container
2. WHEN the frontend is containerized THEN the system SHALL create a Dockerfile that builds the React app and serves it with nginx
3. WHEN Docker Compose is configured THEN the system SHALL orchestrate both services with proper networking and environment variables
4. WHEN containers are built THEN the system SHALL optimize image sizes using multi-stage builds and minimal base images

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines, so that code changes are automatically tested, built, and deployed to AWS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger automated testing for both frontend and backend
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL build and push Docker images to Amazon ECR
3. WHEN images are pushed THEN the system SHALL automatically deploy to staging environment
4. WHEN staging deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide option for production deployment approval
5. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL halt the pipeline and notify developers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive AWS infrastructure as code, so that the deployment environment is reproducible and version-controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure is defined THEN the system SHALL use Terraform or AWS CDK to provision all AWS resources
2. WHEN VPC is created THEN the system SHALL configure public and private subnets across multiple availability zones
3. WHEN load balancer is provisioned THEN the system SHALL distribute traffic across multiple application instances
4. WHEN database is configured THEN the system SHALL use RDS with automated backups and multi-AZ deployment
5. WHEN security groups are defined THEN the system SHALL implement least-privilege access controls

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the application hardened for production, so that it meets enterprise security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN HTTPS is configured THEN the system SHALL use SSL/TLS certificates from AWS Certificate Manager
2. WHEN secrets are managed THEN the system SHALL store sensitive data in AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
3. WHEN authentication is implemented THEN the system SHALL use secure JWT token handling with proper expiration
4. WHEN API endpoints are exposed THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and input validation
5. WHEN containers run THEN the system SHALL use non-root users and read-only filesystems where possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a site reliability engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging, so that I can maintain system health and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN application runs THEN the system SHALL send logs to AWS CloudWatch with structured logging
2. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL track application performance, error rates, and business metrics
3. WHEN alerts are configured THEN the system SHALL notify on-call engineers of critical issues
4. WHEN health checks are implemented THEN the system SHALL provide endpoints for load balancer health monitoring
5. WHEN distributed tracing is enabled THEN the system SHALL track requests across frontend and backend services

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the application optimized for performance and scalability, so that it can handle production traffic loads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend assets are served THEN the system SHALL implement CDN distribution via AWS CloudFront
2. WHEN backend scales THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with auto-scaling groups
3. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and query optimization
4. WHEN static assets are cached THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate cache headers and compression
5. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the system SHALL implement response caching where appropriate

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business stakeholder, I want automated backup and disaster recovery, so that the application can recover from failures with minimal data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database backups are taken THEN the system SHALL perform automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
2. WHEN application data is stored THEN the system SHALL replicate critical data across multiple availability zones
3. WHEN disaster recovery is tested THEN the system SHALL provide runbooks for recovery procedures
4. WHEN backups are retained THEN the system SHALL follow compliance requirements for data retention
5. IF primary region fails THEN the system SHALL support failover to secondary region

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the deployment to meet regulatory requirements, so that the application can operate in regulated environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data at rest using AWS KMS
3. WHEN access is logged THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails of all administrative actions
4. WHEN environments are separated THEN the system SHALL maintain strict isolation between staging and production
5. WHEN compliance is verified THEN the system SHALL provide documentation for security audits
