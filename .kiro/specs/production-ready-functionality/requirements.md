5. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive audit trails for compliance

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the application to be optimized for production deployment, so that it can handle real-world traffic and scale appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL initialize all services with proper health checks
2. WHEN under load THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with appropriate caching and optimization
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling with load balancing
4. WHEN monitoring production THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive metrics and alerting
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments with rollback capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a cloud platform user, I want real-time updates and notifications, so that I can stay informed about infrastructure changes and system events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure changes occur THEN the system SHALL push real-time updates via WebSocket connections
2. WHEN deployments are running THEN the system SHALL stream deployment progress and status updates
3. WHEN alerts are triggered THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications through configured channels
