# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature encompasses completing the core functionality of the CloudWeave cloud platform management system. The application currently has a solid foundation with JWT authentication, glassmorphism UI components, and a well-structured React frontend with Go backend. However, several critical components need to be implemented to make it a fully functional cloud management platform, including database integration, real authentication, comprehensive API endpoints, data management features, and complete UI functionality.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting features, so that I can maintain system health and respond to issues proactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time metrics and performance data
2. WHEN system thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL trigger alerts and notifications
3. WHEN viewing logs THEN the system SHALL provide searchable, filterable log aggregation
