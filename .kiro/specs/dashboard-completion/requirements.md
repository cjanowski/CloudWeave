# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The dashboard currently has several sub-tabs that are not properly connected to backend services and only display template content. This feature will complete the dashboard by implementing functional sub-tabs with real data integration, proper error handling, and responsive UI components. The focus is on connecting existing backend services to the frontend dashboard tabs including costs, security, compliance, and other monitoring features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to view real cost management data in the dashboard costs tab, so that I can monitor and analyze my cloud spending effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on the "Costs" tab THEN the system SHALL display actual cost data from the backend cost management service
2. WHEN cost data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN cost data fails to load THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with retry options
4. WHEN cost data is available THEN the system SHALL display charts showing cost trends, breakdowns by service, and current spending
5. IF no cost data exists THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with guidance on setting up cost tracking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to view security metrics and alerts in the dashboard security tab, so that I can quickly assess the security posture of my infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on the "Security" tab THEN the system SHALL display current security scan results and vulnerability counts
2. WHEN security data is loading THEN the system SHALL show skeleton loading components
3. WHEN critical security alerts exist THEN the system SHALL highlight them prominently with appropriate severity indicators
4. WHEN the user clicks on a security alert THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed security page
5. IF no security scans have been performed THEN the system SHALL display guidance on initiating security scans

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to view compliance status in the dashboard compliance tab, so that I can monitor adherence to regulatory frameworks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on the "Compliance" tab THEN the system SHALL display compliance framework status and scores
2. WHEN compliance data is being fetched THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators
3. WHEN compliance violations exist THEN the system SHALL display them with severity levels and remediation suggestions
4. WHEN the user clicks on a compliance item THEN the system SHALL show detailed compliance information
5. IF no compliance frameworks are configured THEN the system SHALL provide setup guidance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to view infrastructure metrics in the dashboard infrastructure tab, so that I can monitor resource utilization and performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on the "Infrastructure" tab THEN the system SHALL display current infrastructure metrics including CPU, memory, and network usage
2. WHEN metrics are loading THEN the system SHALL show chart placeholders with loading animations
3. WHEN infrastructure alerts exist THEN the system SHALL display them with appropriate priority indicators
4. WHEN the user hovers over metric charts THEN the system SHALL show detailed tooltips with specific values
5. IF no infrastructure is monitored THEN the system SHALL display onboarding guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want all dashboard tabs to have consistent navigation and state management, so that I can seamlessly switch between different views without losing context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user switches between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain the selected tab state in the URL
2. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL restore the previously selected tab
3. WHEN tab content is loading THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous API calls for the same data
4. WHEN the user navigates away and returns THEN the system SHALL cache recent data to improve performance
5. WHEN real-time updates are available THEN the system SHALL update the active tab content automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the dashboard to handle demo mode appropriately, so that I can explore the platform features with sample data when not connected to real services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is in demo mode THEN all dashboard tabs SHALL display realistic sample data
2. WHEN demo data is being generated THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
3. WHEN the user switches from demo to live mode THEN the system SHALL clear demo data and fetch real data
4. WHEN demo mode is active THEN the system SHALL display clear indicators that the data is simulated
5. IF demo data generation fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to static placeholder content
